# character-graph

Turning **stories** into interactive **graphs** with characters as nodes and relationships as edges.

## ✅ Current state :
1. Detect characters and more -> **NER**
2. Preprocessing -> **Coreference Resolution**
3. Improving NER and CR with some tricks
4. Get each character associated to each sentence (group of sentences for optimization)

## 🎯 TO-DO :
### Main
- Final improvement for NER (handle double characters identity)
- Matrix of interactions

### Secondary
- Convert the matrix into graph
- Evaluation
- Unit tests
- Comments

## ⁉️ Thinking :
- Optimization
