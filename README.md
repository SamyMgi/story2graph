# character-graph

Turning **stories** into interactive **graphs** with characters as nodes and relationships as edges.

## ‚úÖ Current state :
1. Detect characters and more -> **NER**
2. Preprocessing -> **Coreference Resolution**
3. Improving NER and CR with some tricks
4. Get each character associated to each sentence (group of sentences for optimization)
5. **Matrix of interaction** between characters.
6. Matrix converted to **interactive Graph**
7. Graph can be **saved** to .html

## üéØ TO-DO :
### Main
- Integrate EntityExtractor to CorefResolution
- Improve graph visualization
- JSON export for Interaction Matrix

### Secondary
- Evaluation
- Comments

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Thinking :
- Multiple identity accuracy
- Optimization
